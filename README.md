# Income Evaluation Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify individuals' income levels as either below or above $50,000 based on various demographic and employment-related features. The dataset used in this project is preprocessed and analyzed to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models.

## Project Structure
The project follows these key steps:
1. **Data Wrangling and Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Assessing data cleanliness
   - Exploring salary-influencing variables
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying patterns and trends
   - Utilizing statistical techniques to reduce variables
3. **Model Building**
   - Preprocessing and feature selection
   - Implementing four classification models:
     - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Comparing model results using classification reports
   - Analyzing performance and generalizability

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis and modeling steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook Income_evaluation_project__Elham_ALMasharfeh.ipynb
```

## Key Questions Addressed
- Are there any discriminatory patterns in the dataset?
- Do any unexpected biases exist in the data?
- What are the advantages and challenges of each model?
- How well do the models generalize to new, unseen data?

## Results
The project provides insights into the most effective model for income classification and highlights potential biases in the dataset.
